# THM

This repository contains notes on some of the rooms I solved on [Tryhackme](https://tryhackme.com/).

It also contains [a python script](setup.py) to automatically setup a directory with a readme for notes for any room. Call it with the name of any THM room (not the title, but the name in the url) and it'll setup a directory for you.  
Feel free to edit/improve the script and create a pull request afterward!
